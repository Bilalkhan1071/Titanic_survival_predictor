# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
- Created a prediction model using a Kaggle dataset to predict which passengers on the Titanic would survive for a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)
- Used Scikit Learn along with pandas and numpy to handle and transform the data set to allow for efficient predictions
- Handled data using imputers and encoders
- Created a model using RandomForestClassifier due to personal preference
